# Github_User_Data_Scrapper
We can find github user profile data here,
when we search the correct username in the search bar,
this is fetch the data usign github user api & return data in the screen,
when username is incorrect it'll be show not found message!

In this project I used HTML, CSS, JS & Tailwind CSS.
